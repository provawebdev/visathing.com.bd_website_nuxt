                  VISAThing is a registered trademark of Your Trip Mate Limited
                  based out of Bangladesh. We are a travel technology company
                  striving to build a convenient travel ecosystem by connecting
                  different immigration/consular authorities to global
                  population of travelers with the help of innovative services

                <h2>What We Do?</h2>
                <p>
                  We aggressively target any issues in the global travel
                  scenario and donâ€™t rest until we find a solution. As VISAThing
                  was founded in Bangladesh, we started from the scratch by
                  eliminating recurring visa hassles one by one for Bangladeshi
                  travelers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the years we have successfully eradicated the lack of
                  accurate travel/visa information by building the largest visa
                  database www.visathing.com with accurate visa and travel
                  information. We tried to answer the questions of the
                  Bangladeshi travelers by dedicated visa hotline and social
                  medias. We have developed services that would guide a traveler
                  prepare a visa application with proper documentation with our
                  premium consultancy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We have enabled travelers to avoid unnecessary cross-country
                  trips to non-resident embassies for visa processing with our
                  Visa Processing Service. We have catered the need of students
                  who would be lost and could use some guidance on picking the
                  most suitable universities and study program and carry out the
                  entire process including Admission and Student Visa
                  Processing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We have built Visa Management System and enabled individual
                  travelers, business entities and government/non-government
                  offices to apply for visa online, find requirements, create
                  individual/organization profile and much more. Our Online
                  Passport Tracking and Notification System keep them posted;
                  always! Thus, we have become the visa partner of Bangladeshi
                  travelers who relies on us heavily to guide them through the
                  taxing visa journeys.
